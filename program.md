## Talk Abstracts

#### Jacob Taylor, University of Maryland/JQI - "Enabling the quantum ecosystem"

#### Carmen G. Almudever, Technical University of Valencia - "Closing the Gaps Between Open Quantum Software and Hardware"
**Abstract**
In this talk, we will address the challenges and opportunities towards open hardware and its implications for building full-stack quantum computing systems. We will first revisit full-stack quantum computing architectures focusing on its higher layers (quantum software). We will then highlight the diversity in alternatives across the stack and need for tight cross-layer co-design. We will introduce structured design space exploration methodologies as a predecessor for automated design.  We will finalize the talk by discussing the attributes that the community needs to pursue to achieve open quantum hardware, namely, modularity and abstraction, interoperability, standardized libraries, and optimal design. 

#### Zlatko K. Minev, IBM Research - "To design & analyze superconducting qubits"

#### Loic Henriet, PASQAL – “Pulser: An open-source package for the design of pulse sequences in programmable neutral-atom arrays”
**Abstract**
Programmable arrays of hundreds of Rydberg atoms have recently enabled the exploration of remarkable phenomena in many-body quantum physics. In addition, the development of high-fidelity quantum gates are making them promising architectures for the implementation of quantum circuits. We present here Pulser, an open-source Python library for programming neutral-atom devices at the pulse level. The low-level nature of Pulser makes it a versatile framework for quantum control both in the digital and analog settings. The library also contains simulation routines for studying and exploring the outcome of pulse sequences for small systems.

#### Anurag Saha Roy, Forschungszentrum Jülich “Automated quantum device bring-up using the open-source C3 toolset”
**Abstract**
Scaling up quantum computation is currently limited not by the number of qubits, but the entangling gate infidelity. However, the highly detailed system characterization required to understand the underlying error sources is an arduous process and impractical with increasing chip size. Open-loop optimal control techniques allow for the improvement of gates but are limited by the models they are based on. To rectify the situation, an integrated open-source tool-set for Control, Calibration and Characterization, capable of open-loop pulse optimization, model-free calibration, model fitting and refinement is presented here. In this talk we highlight the major capabilities of this library as well as some interesting applications and future plans.

#### Irfan Siddiqi, Lawrence Berkeley National Lab - "Advancing Deep Collaborative Research in Superconducting Quantum Computing @ LBNL"
**Abstract**
With recent advances in state-of-the-art superconducting quantum computing platforms, research in all areas of Quantum Information Science and Technology (QuIST) has advanced at an accelerated pace over the last few years. Access to hardware platforms remains a critical enabling factor in the continued development and evolution of quantum computing. At the Advanced Quantum Testbed, we have built a multidisciplinary science and technology environment, providing access to the full stack of software and hardware to our collaborative Users from Academia, National Labs, and Industry. The pre-existing multidisciplinary tradition of advanced, customized hardware development and design at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab has been of particular advantage in our ongoing expanding efforts. In this talk, I will provide an overview of the AQT experimental platform, and highlight intra- and inter-Lab collaborations involved in making this platform possible. I will also address the potential for our published and open-sourced hardware designs, both existing and planned, to lower the barrier-to-entry for early-career researchers to engage in experimental research in QuIST.
